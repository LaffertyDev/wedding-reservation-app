# Wedding Reservation App

This home-cooked app serves as how my wedding guests will manage their reservation. I know we could use off-the-shelf software to do this (for mostly free) but I felt the itch to build it myself.

And now here we are!

## Frontend

Built using vanilla javascript wherever possible, with a hefty dose of web components.

* Bulma.css
* Normalize.css


## Backend

For the backend, I wanted to try my hand at some new systems that I've heard about. For my day-job I heavily use Microsoft Azure so wanted to branch out to something a little more lightweight.

## Database

## Core Design
